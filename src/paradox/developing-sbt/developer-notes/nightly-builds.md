## Nightly Builds

The latest development versions of $app_version$ are available as nightly builds on
[Typesafe Snapshots]($typesafe_ivy_snapshots$).

To use a nightly build, the instructions are the same for @ref:[normal manual setup][Setup] except:

1. Download the launcher jar from one of the subdirectories of `nightly-launcher`. They should be listed in
  chronological order, so the most recent one will be last.
1. The version number is the name of the subdirectory and is of the form `$app_version$.x-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss`. Use this in
  a build.properties file.
1. Call your script something like `sbt-nightly` to retain access to a stable sbt launcher. The documentation will refer
  to the script as sbt, however.

Related to the third point, remember that an `sbt.version` setting in `<build-base>/project/build.properties` determines
the version of sbt to use in a project. If it is not present, the default version associated with the launcher is used.
This means that you must set `sbt.version=yyyyMMdd-HHmmss` in an existing `<build-base>/project/build.properties`. You
can verify the right version of sbt is being used to build a project by running `about`.

To reduce problems, it is recommended to not use a launcher jar for one nightly version to launch a different nightly
version of sbt.
