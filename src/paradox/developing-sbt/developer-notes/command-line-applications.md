## Creating Command Line Applications Using sbt


There are several components of sbt that may be used to create a command line application. The
@ref:[launcher][Sbt-Launcher] and the [command system][Commands] are the two main ones illustrated here.

As described on the @ref[launcher page][Sbt-Launcher], a launched application implements the `xsbti.AppMain` interface
and defines a brief configuration file that users pass to the launcher to run the application. To use the command
system, an application sets up a [State][Build-State] instance that provides [command implementations][Commands] and the
initial commands to run. A minimal hello world example is given below.

### Hello World Example

There are three files in this example:

* `build.sbt`
* `Main.scala`
* `hello.build.properties`

To try out this example:

1. Put the first two files in a new directory
1. In sbt's shell run `publishLocal` in that directory
1. Run `sbt @path/to/hello.build.properties` to run the application.

Like for sbt itself, you can specify commands from the command line (batch mode) or run them at an prompt (interactive
  mode).

#### Build Definition: `build.sbt`

The `build.sbt` file should define the standard settings: `name`, `version`, and `organization`. To use the sbt command
system, a dependency on the `command` module is needed. To use the task system, add a dependency on the `task-system`
module as well.

```scala
organization := "org.example"
name := "hello"
version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-sbt" % "command" % "0.12.0"
```

#### Application: `Main.scala`

The application itself is defined by implementing [xsbti.AppMain](../api/xsbti/AppMain.html). The basic steps are:

1. Provide command definitions. These are the commands that are available for users to run.
1. Define initial commands. These are the commands that are initially scheduled to run. For example, an application will
  typically add anything specified on the command line (what sbt calls batch mode) and if no commands are defined, enter
  interactive mode by running the 'shell' command.
1. Set up logging. The default setup in the example rotates the log file after each user interaction and sends brief
  logging to the console and verbose logging to the log file.

```scala
package org.example

import sbt._
import java.io.{File, PrintWriter}

final class Main extends xsbti.AppMain {
  /** Defines the entry point for the application.
   * The call to `initialState` sets up the application.
   * The call to runLogged starts command processing.
   */
  def run(configuration: xsbti.AppConfiguration): xsbti.MainResult =
    MainLoop.runLogged( initialState(configuration) )

  /** Sets up the application by constructing an initial State instance with the
   * supported commands and initial commands to run.  See the State API documentation
   * for details.
   */
  def initialState(configuration: xsbti.AppConfiguration): State = {
    val commandDefinitions = hello +: BasicCommands.allBasicCommands
    val commandsToRun = Hello +: "iflast shell" +: configuration.arguments.map(_.trim)
    State(
      configuration,
      commandDefinitions,
      Set.empty,
      None,
      commandsToRun,
      State.newHistory,
      AttributeMap.empty,
      initialGlobalLogging,
      State.Continue
    )
  }

  // defines an example command.  see the Commands page for details.
  val Hello = "hello"
  val hello = Command.command(Hello) { s =>
    s.log.info("Hello!")
    s
  }

  /** Configures logging to log to a temporary backing file as well as to the console.
   * An application would need to do more here to customize the logging level and
   * provide access to the backing file (like sbt's last command and logLevel setting).
   */
  def initialGlobalLogging: GlobalLogging =
    GlobalLogging.initial(MainLogging.globalDefault _, File.createTempFile("hello", "log"))
}
```

#### Launcher configuration file: `hello.build.properties`

The launcher needs a configuration file in order to retrieve and run an application. `hello.build.properties`:

```
[scala]
  version: 2.9.1

[app]
  org: org.example
  name: hello
  version: 0.1-SNAPSHOT
  class: org.example.Main
  components: xsbti
  cross-versioned: true
